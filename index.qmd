# It's me, hi!

My name is Thomas, I'm a runner, mathematician, and currently working as a data scientist at Wahoo Fitness LLC.
I studied Computational Engineering Science at RWTH Aachen University and then went ont to get a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.

When I'm not using `pandas` (or [`polars`](https://www.pola.rs/)!) to turn wide dataframes into long ones, I like to run through forests and around tracks.
