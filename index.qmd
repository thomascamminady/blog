# It's me, hi!

When I'm not using `pandas` (or [`polars`](https://www.pola.rs/)!) to turn wide dataframes into long ones or [spend too much time](http://3.92.224.28) [thinking about colors](https://thomascamminady.github.io/dicopal/#stop-talking-i-want-colors), I like to run through forests and around tracks.
