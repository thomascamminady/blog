We'll be using the following packages in all of the upcoming posts.
The package `camminapy` can be installed via `poetry` and running `altair_theme` provides
sensible defaults.



```{python}
import polars as pl
import numpy as np
import altair as alt
from camminapy.plot import altair_theme

altair_theme()
```


We'll be using `polars` instead of `pandas` and `altair>=5.0.1`.
