Last week I received a new work Macbook that uses the newer M1 chip (M1 Max). Since then I am experiencing issues with the connectivity of the MX Mechanical Mini.\nAs of now (Feb 22, 2023) I have no solution for this issue."

Waking up the keyboard then takes some three to four seconds, time during which no keystrokes are recorded. This is especially annoying for me, since I work as a developer and there are frequent periods of not typing (but thinking), followed by quick bursts of typing.\nI did not notice this issue on the Intel-based Macbook which makes me wonder whether this is an issue on the hardware side of things."

There are two keys which contain measurements (thing of the first key of measurements with recording device A and B, and the second key of different days of the recordings.) Each measurement is a time series with columns t and time representing the local and global time, respectively.

However, It is worth outlining the steps that I am doing in the analysis. These steps include: - The conversion of time stamps to datetime formats. - Grouping data over keys and taking the mean value of the initial N samples of some columns. - Subtracting those means from different columns. - Computing rolling means of some columns and using those computed means to replace data in those rows where the mean is below a certain threshold. - Compute a bunch of derived columns that use one or more of the existing columns in some transformation. Those are row wise operations that require no grouping or anything fancy."

    "text": "Using polars\nHere’s my implementation using polars for a total of 50 lines of code (LOC). I scan the data instead of reading it directly to run the whole pipeline in a lazy way. Only the call to collect at the end actually forces a computation. Internally, the operations can be optimized and made more efficient. I really like the chaining of operations. While it is somewhat verbose, it is consistent: Every new operation just gets chained to the existing operations with the .keyword() syntax. Computing averages over groups with the .median().over() syntax feels nicer than the pandas equivalent of .groupby().transform().\nCreating new columns with the .with_columns() syntax has the downside, that you need to chain multiple calls to .with_columns() after another if you want to access a column that was created in a prior computation. This is also the reason why my polars implementation has roughly twice the number of LOC when compared with the pandas implementation.\nOne downside that I saw is that, different from pandas, I do not get any kind of auto-complete for the columns that are in a data frame when using the pl.col(\"column name\") syntax. In pandas, VSCode will allow you to auto-complete the column name if you start typing df[\"column and column_name will pop up as a suggestion if it is an element of the data frame.\nlazy_frame = (\n    pl.scan_parquet(path)\n    .rename(mapping={\"column1\": \"criteria2\"})\n    .with_columns(\n        [\n            pl.col(\"time\").str.strptime(pl.Datetime, fmt=\"%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S%.f\"),\n            (pl.col(\"y1\") * 16.7).alias(\"z1\"),\n        ]\n    )\n    .with_columns(\n        [\n            pl.col(\"y2\").head(20).median().over(\"criteria1\", \"criteria2\").alias(\"z3\"),\n            pl.col(\"z1\").head(20).median().over(\"criteria1\", \"criteria2\").alias(\"z4\"),\n            pl.col(\"t\").min().over(\"criteria1\", \"criteria2\").alias(\"z5\"),\n        ]\n    )\n    .with_columns((pl.col(\"z4\") - pl.col(\"z3\")).alias(\"z6\"))\n    .with_columns(\n        [\n            (pl.col(\"z1\") - pl.col(\"z6\")).alias(\"y8\"),\n            (pl.col(\"y2\").rolling_min(8, center=True) &lt; 10).alias(\"z10\"),\n            (pl.col(\"t\") - pl.col(\"z5\")).alias(\"t\"),\n            pl.when(pl.col(\"y2\").rolling_min(8, center=True) &lt; 10)\n            .then(float(\"nan\"))\n            .otherwise(pl.col(\"y2\"))\n            .alias((\"z2\")),\n        ]\n    )\n    .with_columns(\n        [\n            (2 * 3.14159 / 60 * pl.col(\"y2\") * pl.col(\"y4\")).alias(\"z8\"),\n            (2 * 3.14159 / 60 * pl.col(\"z2\") * pl.col(\"y4\")).alias((\"z7\")),\n            (2 * 3.14159 / 60 * pl.col(\"y8\") * pl.col(\"y4\")).alias(\"y9\"),\n        ]\n    )\n    .with_columns((pl.col(\"y9\") - pl.col(\"z7\")).alias(\"Error\"))\n    .with_columns(\n        (100 * pl.col(\"Error\") / pl.col(\"z7\")).alias(\"Percentage Error\"),\n    )\n    .with_columns(((0.5 * pl.col(\"y10\") + 0.5 * pl.col(\"y11\"))).alias(\"z13\"))\n    .with_columns((313 * pl.col(\"y12\") / (pl.col(\"z13\") + 273)).alias(\"z12\"))\n    .select([\"a list of some 10 columns that we want to preserve\"])\n)\nframe = lazy_frame.collect()"

Running both examples 10 times gives the following timing results:\npolars: 0.021s +- 0.001s\npandas: 0.181s +- 0.006s\nratios: 8.700  +- 0.375\nThat is, the polars implementation runs about 8 to 9 times faster on my 2022 MacBook Pro with an M1 Max chip and 32 GB of RAM. I am using python 3.10, pandas 1.4.3 and polars 0.16.9. Additionally, I created a larger parquet file by just concatenating the original data frame together for one hundred times, i.e.\ndf = pd.read_parquet(\"./parquet/reduced_data.parquet\")\nlargedf = pd.concat([df]*100)\nlargedf.to_parquet(\"./parquet/100reduced_data.parquet\")\nThis is of course not representing an actual dataset that is 100 times larger, but it at least shows a trend of the performance for a potentially larger dataset. Here we’re getting the following timings\npolars: 1.028s +- 0.026s\npandas: 18.813s +- 0.403s\nratios: 18.315  +- 0.490\nThe ratio between both implementations has grown when going from 40k rows to 4.4M rows.

It seems like this might be a lower bound when moving to larger files but I will keep an eye on that. Given that I am only writing polars code since a month, I am happy with this performance gain.\nFrom an implementation point of view, I was much faster using pandas. I have been using pandas for two years now and I guess that’s just showing here. I really appreciate the auto complete feature for the column names which is a feature that I miss when using polars.\nI do like the chaining of operations, but it makes the code longer and it is a bit annoying having to write code like this (using pandas):\ndf[\"y\"] = 123 + df[\"x\"]\ndf[\"z\"] = 456 + df[\"y\"]\nin this way (using polars):\ndf.with_columns((pl.col(\"x\") + 123).alias(\"y\"))\n    .with_columns((pl.col(\"y\") + 456).alias(\"z\"))\nEspecially with long column names and black formatting, this can double the number of LOC.\nOverall I am quite happy with my polars experience and I will continue using it for project in the futures. One thing I hope for, is that altair can be used with polars data frames instead of needing to call .to_pandas() when passing the data to a chart.\nThanks for reading :)"
